1. Interesting animation of a hamburger menu that I will defintitely redesign a bit and use again. I like that it keeps its same footprint on the page.
2. However, the javascript did not work as described. I checked his completed source code against mine and cannot find why the javascript is not being called or activated. Checked all spelling and links but it's a mystery for now.
